<h2>Two lines about myself</h2>

<p>
:art:&nbsp;*Hey there!*
</p>

<p>
Thank you for visiting my homepage. My name is **Jnanadarshan Nayak** (pronounced as Gyana-Darshan) and, I am a Management professional working with one of the world's largest IT Services providers. I've been a tech enthusiast since early childhood and believe, tech can be a great equalizer in this unjust world. I enjoy DIY stuff and gardening during my leisure and, though not an avid reader, I do read a lot throughout the day across various interest areas.

I have used this website to write random thoughts in short and long-form content. Since I am a techie by heart, most of my writings are on tech. And like everyone else life teaches a lot of lessons which I sometimes put down in words. 

*That's it for now!! Will keep updating!*
