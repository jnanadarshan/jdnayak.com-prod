This website has existed in various forms since 2012, when I finally discovered how to build and deploy websites without spending any money on hosting. Till date I have never spent any money on hosting my websites (though AWS charges few Rupees for the static files I host). This website has always been a combination of my blog and CV for years. Now that I have full fledged blog [jnan.co](https://jnan.co) for thoughtful blogging, I always missed a place to put random thoughts and talk about all the interesting DIY stuff that I do. Finally I have decided to give this website another chance as a frequent blog with less formal content. Let's see how this goes.

## How this website is hosted for free?

Many people still think that one needs to have a hosting service in order to host their websites. While that is true for enterprises and anyone wanting to run full scale websites with user accounts, web apps and dynamic content vast majority of general users will be fine with `static` websites. I would highly encourage any person interested in having a web presence should start reading about `static` web pages, `jekyll`, `github pages` and AWS `S3` website hosting. 

I have learned a lot over the years and someday I intend to put a super simple step by step guide on how to get started with a simple blog or website. This is a time consuming and future project and also there are plenty of resources already available on the web regarding how to create a website and host it on `Github pages` or `Amazon S3` for free or at dirt cheap rates.

*this will be updated regularly.....
