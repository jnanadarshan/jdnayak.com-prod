There is something different about Cuttack. This city has this amazing ability to attract people from various parts of the state and bind those people forever whether you live in the city or not.  I have spent a significant part of my life living in the City.  Though I don't live in the city for almost 7 years now I consider myself a native of the city and love the city dearly.

That's why it pains me to see the current state and the seemingly bleak future of Cuttack. It's evident that globally those cities are thriving which can attract large scale manufacturing or knowledge-based industries. Education is also another factor for bringing people into the city. 

As it's happening in many North American and European cities,  bigger cities attracting more talent therefore more manufacturing and service industries are moving there in search of better talents.  Unfortunately over the last few decades, Cuttack has lost a significant portion of large-scale manufacturing surrounding the city. Undoubtedly cities that are able to attract knowledge workers are growing at a rapid pace and the multiplier effect only help cement their position to attract further investment and talent.  Here also, the current Odisha Government is not serious about bringing new economy-based companies to the state and whatever companies are coming because of large resource pools, are setting up their shops in Bhubaneswar. 

The Cuttack-Bhubaneswar urban region has a huge potential to be developed as the next tech hub for Eastern India because there is a large Odia diaspora working in these Tech companies who are desperate to come back and settle in the state. Currently, Cuttack has zero presence of any multinational service-based organization Bhubaneswar has a handful and it slowly increasing. 

Off late Cuttack has also been ignored in getting its fair share of important institutions like IITs, IIMs, or AIIMs. The picture of the city again for education destination is also questionable as  Ravenshaw University alone cannot carry the baton for the coming years. 

As it is happening across multiple Eastern states in India, there is a constant outflow of young people moving to larger cities for better education and work prospects.  The same is also happening with Cuttack. 

*Until and unless the city creates jobs quickly, attracts a large University and  investments in manufacturing or service sectors,  the downward spiral of the city will continue and it will become a ghost town one day.*
